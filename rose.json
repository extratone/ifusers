          "text": "*Topics View*\n\n *•* [*__GitHub Issue__*](https://github.com/extratone/ifusers/issue/3)\n\nIn November 2021, Telegram released an entirely different way of organizing Groups like ours, but it wasn't until the very end of the year that they made it available to small, niche Groups... like ours. I decided to try turning on the toggle in admin settings, which will organize your view _by default_ into the very channel list-looking interface you see represented above.\n\n_However_, the first thing you should know is that you can revert back to the same single message feed with a toggle in the tripple dot menu found near the upper-right corner of your app.\n\nPlease note, _this is by no means a permanent change_. I would really consider it a _favor_, actually, if you'd be willing to express your thoughts at least in single-anonymized-poll-option form. ⇩\n\nMembers with opinions (or otherwise:) please do vote in [*__the group poll__*](https://t.me/ifusers/19/24) regarding whether or not topics will continue to be implemented, going forward.\n\nFrom [*__Telegram's blog post__*](https://telegram.org/blog/topics-in-groups-collectible-usernames):\n\n*\"Topics in Groups\"*\n_Telegram groups can support huge communities with hundreds of thousands of users. To keep these chats easy to read, groups with_ _*over 200 members* can now_ _*enable topics* and create separate spaces for any subject.\n\nTopics function as_ _*individual chats* within the group – supporting their own_ _*shared media* and_ _*notification settings*. Members are free to chat in any topic from Anime to Zoology, using all their favorite features like_ [___polls___](https://t.me/TelegramTips/207)_,_ [___pinned messages___](https://t.me/TelegramTips/302) _and_ [___bots___](https://t.me/telegram/195)_.\n\nThis feature is intended specifically for_ _*large groups*, adding new ways to customize their chats and promote discussion._ \n\n*___Topics Index___*\n\nThanks to the magic of Rose, you should be able to view this index (in note form) in any chat with one of two commands: `/topics` or `(hashtag)topics`.\n\n[*__Meta/Feedback__*](https://t.me/ifusers/19)\nThis topic was created specifically for discussion about *_this Telegram group, itself_*, though you should feel free to talk about the wider _Infinite Flight_ community here if you feel the need to.\n\n[*__Resources__*](https://t.me/ifusers/27)\nOne of the best advantages to Telegram as a platform for us Infinite Flight folks is how well it lends toward file sharing. This topic encompasses sharing replay/flight plan files as well as links to relevant tools/guides/forum posts you discover.\n\n[*__Media__*](https://t.me/ifusers/29)\nThe very little foresight I'm actually able to manifest about the future (or non-future) of this group suggests that at least two distinct file sharing-alotted Topics are required. It's okay - in this one - to spam image, audio, and video files.\n\n[*__Events/News/Live/Groups__*](https://t.me/ifusers/31)\nThis topic is for time-sensitive activity, like coordinating multiplayer in-game participation, planning events, and _especially_ just speaking to other folks currently flying on the same server, since there's no way to do that in-game.\n\n[*__Dev__*](https://t.me/ifusers/35)\nThis topic is reserved for any/all software (and otherwise) development pertaining to flight simulation or other aviation-adjacent subjects. From working with the APIs to coordinating bug reports to (whatever magic rituals scenary editors must do.)\n\n[*__Squawk__*](https://t.me/ifusers/33)\nThis topic is perhaps the most open - new members will probably find it best to silence it immediately. Bots are a big part of Telegram's existence, as they are of Infinite Flight's. Here, you should feel 100% free to interact with/screw around with automated processes (including bots.)\n#meta #topics #telegram\n[Telegra.ph Post](buttonurl://https://telegra.ph/Infinite-Flight-Users-Telegram-Group-Topics-Index-01-01)\n[GitHub Issue](buttonurl://https://github.com/extratone/ifusers/issues/3)\n[Group Poll](buttonurl://https://t.me/ifusers/19/24)\n[Meta/Feedback](buttonurl://https://t.me/ifusers/19)\n[Resources](buttonurl://https://t.me/ifusers/27)\n[Media](buttonurl://https://t.me/ifusers/29)\n[Events/News/Live/Groups](buttonurl://https://t.me/ifusers/31)\n[Dev](buttonurl://https://t.me/ifusers/35)\n[Squawk](buttonurl://https://t.me/ifusers/33)",

I’ve finally drafted a presentable copy of the Big Bad Chat Rules.\n\nYou can find a revision-tracked version of this document on the GitHub repo I created, [here](https://github.com/extratone/columbia/blob/main/rules.md).\n\nI have also published [a parallel version](https://telegra.ph/ColumbiaMO-Telegram-Chat-Rules-11-30) of this document to Telegram’s longform service, Telegra.ph.\n\n1. *ColumbiaMO Local Chat* is a place to discuss current events and culture in a friendly, collegial way. We invite you to be smart, kind, welcoming, funny, charming, incisive, prescient, skeptical: whoever you are on your best day.\n2. *ColumbiaMO Local Chat* is reserved for people who live, have lived, or intend to live in mid-Missouri as well as travelers through the area. \n3. Share news, opinions, personal experiences, charts, data, photos, tweets, and other media. Do not share misinformation, disinformation, or spam — including in DMs to other members.\n4. Do not promote your own hustles — or your clients’ hustles — more than *once per day.*\n5. Disruptive off-topic posts (random interjections) are discouraged and unwelcome.\n6. Discuss subjects in good faith. Do not troll, mock, or harass other members of the community.\n7. Pseudonyms are welcome, and you do not have to disclose where you work, but do not impersonate anyone.\n8. Keep it safe for work. *ColumbiaMO Local Chat* is not the place for disturbing images, racy pictures, or anything else you wouldn’t want to share with your coworkers or family.\n9. Be inclusive of all people and points of view. This is particularly true for Black, Indigenous, and people of color, and people in the LBGTQ+ community. We will remove any homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, or racist content without discussion.\n10. If someone is bothering you or you would like to report a post or member who you believe is violating these rules, please contact one of the Administrators or Moderators.\n11. Final moderation decisions are subject to the whims of the Admins and Mods.\n12. We expect to update these rules as necessary. When we do, you’ll see a notification attached to this message.\n13. Follow the spirit of these rules as well as the letter of them. Do not become an edgelord. We err on the side of removing borderline content — and borderline users — from the channel.\n14. At least for the moment, *automated* sharing of Crypto and sex-related content is a banable offense.",
