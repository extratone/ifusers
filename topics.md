In November 2021, Telegram released an entirely different way of organizing Groups like ours, but it wasn't until the very end of the year that they made it available to small, niche Groups... like ours. I decided to try turning on the toggle in admin settings, which will organize your view *by default* into the very channel list-looking interface you see represented above.

*However*, the first thing you should know is that you can revert back to the same single message feed with a toggle in the tripple dot menu found near the upper-right corner of your app. 

Please note, *this is by no means a permanent change*. I would really consider it a *favor*, actually, if you'd be willing to express your thoughts at least in single-anonymized-poll-option form. ⇩

Members with opinions (or otherwise:) please do vote in [**the group poll**](https://t.me/ifusers/19/24) regarding whether or not topics will continue to be implemented, going forward.

From [**Telegram's blog post**](https://telegram.org/blog/topics-in-groups-collectible-usernames):

> ### Topics in Groups
> 
> Telegram groups can support huge communities with hundreds of thousands of users. To keep these chats easy to read, groups with **over 200 members** can now **enable topics** and create separate spaces for any subject.
> 
> Topics function as **individual chats** within the group – supporting their own **shared media** and **notification settings**. Members are free to chat in any topic from _Anime_ to _Zoology_, using all their favorite features like [polls](https://t.me/TelegramTips/207), [pinned messages](https://t.me/TelegramTips/302) and [bots](https://t.me/telegram/195).
> 
> This feature is intended specifically for **large groups**, adding new ways to customize their chats and promote discussion. Later this year, we expect to introduce a different set of tools, tailored to **small groups**. If you want to give topics a test drive, try them out in this [public group](https://t.me/TheForum).
> 
> > Group admins can enable topics in their _Group Settings_, and can control who is allowed to **create and manage topics** in _Permissions_.
> 
> As with anything on Telegram, further updates will bring more powerful tools for both admins and users of this feature.

## Topics Index

Thanks to the magic of Rose, you should be able to view this index (in note form) in any chat with one of two commands: `/topics` or `(hashtag)topics`.

#### [Meta/Feedback](https://t.me/ifusers/19)

This topic was created specifically for discussion about ***this Telegram group, itself***, though you should feel free to talk about the wider *Infinite Flight* community here if you feel the need to.

#### [Resources](https://t.me/ifusers/27)

One of the best advantages to Telegram as a platform for us Infinite Flight folks is how well it lends toward file sharing. This topic encompasses sharing replay/flight plan files as well as links to relevant tools/guides/forum posts you discover.

#### [Media](https://t.me/ifusers/29)

The very little foresight I'm actually able to manifest about the future (or non-future) of this group suggests that at least two distinct file sharing-alotted Topics are required. It's okay - in this one - to spam image, audio, and video files.

#### [Events/News/Live/Groups](https://t.me/ifusers/31)

This topic is for time-sensitive activity, like coordinating multiplayer in-game participation, planning events, and *especially* just speaking to other folks currently flying on the same server, since there's no way to do that in-game.

#### [Dev](https://t.me/ifusers/35)

This topic is reserved for any/all software (and otherwise) development pertaining to flight simulation or other aviation-adjacent subjects. From working with the APIs to coordinating bug reports to (whatever magic rituals scenary editors must do.)

#### [Squawk](https://t.me/ifusers/33)

This topic is perhaps the most open - new members will probably find it best to silence it immediately. Bots are a big part of Telegram's existence, as they are of Infinite Flight's. Here, you should feel 100% free to interact with/screw around with automated processes (including bots.)
